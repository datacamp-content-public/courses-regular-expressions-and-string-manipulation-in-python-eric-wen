## Review of the List Introduced in Lesson 1 as an Example

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4da1725d7c"
```

`@part1`
The list `li_names` was introduced in Lesson 1 as an example.

     `li_names = ['Adele'
                , 'Alan'
                , 'Ana-Maria'
                , 'Aolani'
                , 'Arlene']`

## re.match() vs. re.search()

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0ebb0213f5"
```

`@part1`
Recall our continuing example using the list of names:

     `li_names = ['Adele', 'Alan', 'Ana-Maria', 'Aolani', 'Arlene']`

In order to match `Alan` and `Aolani`, we have compiled the regular expression:

     `regexobj = re.compile(r'.*an')`

We apply this compiled regular expression to the list of names as follows:

    `for sname in li_names:
         romatch = regexobj.match(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(romatch)}\t{romatch}')`

Recall our continuing example using the list of names:

## Output

Here is the output:

`Adele           False   None`
`Alan            True    <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match='Alan'>
`Ana-Maria       False   None`
`Aolani          True    <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Aolan'>`
`Arlene          False   None`
