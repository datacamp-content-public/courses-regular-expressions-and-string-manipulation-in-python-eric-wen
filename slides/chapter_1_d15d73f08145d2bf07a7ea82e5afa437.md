```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "adb3efc71c"
```

`@lower_third`

name: Eric Wen
title: Candidate for Instructor


`@script`
Hi, I'm Eric Wen, and I think you very much for this opportunity to audition with Lesson 2.4 Strings and Compilation Flags of the proposed course: Regular Expressions and String Manipulation.


---
## Topics

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4c206cbe49"
```

`@part1`
- _[Brief review of relevant material covered in earlier lessons]_

- Introducing searching in contrast to matching

- Compilation flags [`RegexFlag`s]


`@script`
I thought it would be helpful to begin with a few slides to cover some prerequisite material that would have been introduced in earlier lessons.  Then, we will cover the main topic in this chapter: Introduction to searching, in contrast to matching and `RegexFlag`s, which were formerly known as Compilation Flags.

## Review of the List Introduced in Lesson 1 as an Example

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4da1725d7c"
```

`@part1`
Introduced list `li_names` in Lesson 1:

     `li_names = ['Adele'
                , 'Alan'
                , 'Ana-Maria'
                , 'Aolani'
                , 'Arlene']`


`@part2`



`@script`
To provide a consistent context for studying regular expressions, the list `li_names` was introduced in Lesson 1 and has been used consistently throughout Lessons 1 and 2.  As you can see, it consists of five names, and regular expressions have been and will be applied to this list of strings.

## Review of the List Introduced in Lesson 1 as an Example

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "da17c139d6"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
Introduced list `li_names` in Lesson 1:

     `li_names = ['Adele'
                , 'Alan'
                , 'Ana-Maria'
                , 'Aolani'
                , 'Arlene']`


`@part2`
Used a `for` loop to traverse it by element:


     `for sname in li_names:
          print(f'{sname}')`

_output:_

     `Adele
      Alan
      Ana-Maria
      Aolani
      Arlene`


`@script`
We use a `for` loop to traverse the list element-by-element, with typical output shown on the lower right.

## Review of Previous Lesson: Introduced wildcard . and Quantifiers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bc6e28c66a"
```

`@part1`
In Lesson 2.3 we built the following compiled regular expression and applied `re.match()` to the elements or our list, `li_names`, to only match `Alan` and `Aolani`:

     `import re
      regexobj = re.compile(r'.*an')
      for sname in li_names:
           romatch = regexobj.match(sname)
           print(f'{sname:11}{bool(romatch)} \t{romatch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 4), match='Alan'>
      Ana-Maria   False     None
      Aolani      True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 5), match='Aolan'>
      Arlene      False     None`


`@script`
The previous lesson introduced students to `re.match()`, as well as the wildcard `.` which matches any single character except newline `\n`, and quantifiers like `*` which matches zero or more of the previous character.  One of the examples would have covered the regular expression shown in this slide, which is carried-over into this lesson.

## Searching vs. Matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0ebb0213f5"
```

`@part1`
**OBJECTIVE:** Understand the difference between matching vs. searching in Python's regular expression module `re`.

|**Method** | **Python** |**Description **|
|-----------|------------|-----------|
|Match  | `re.match()` | Matches regular expression from the beginning of  a word |
|Search | `re.search()`| Searches for regular expression anywhere within a word | 



**PROBLEM:** match `Alan` and `Aolani`, entries in our familiar list of names:

     `li_names = ['Adele', 'Alan', 'Ana-Maria', 'Aolani', 'Arlene']`


`@script`
Now, we begin the content for this lesson....

In addition to `re.match()`, the regular expression matching method that we have been using, Python's regular expression library, `re`, also provides `re.search()`.

The difference is that `re.match()` begins its attempt to "match" from the beginning of each string, while `re.search()` can "search" for the pattern **_anywhere_** within the target string.

----------
Recall our continuing example using the list of names:

     `li_names = ['Adele', 'Alan', 'Ana-Maria', 'Aolani', 'Arlene']`

Suppose that we would like to match the names `Alan` and `Aolani`.  How could we do this?

|**Method** | **Python** |**Description **|
|-----------|------------|-----------|
|Match  | `re.match()` | Matches regular expression from the beginning of  a word |

**PROBLEM:** match the `Alan` and `Aolani`, entries in our familiar list of names:

     `li_names = ['Adele', 'Alan', 'Ana-Maria', 'Aolani', 'Arlene']
                              ^^                    ^^`

**APPROACH:** Notice that both `Alan` and `Aolani` contain the characters `an`.


`@script`
We could notice that both names contain the string `an`.  Therefore, we should write a regular expression to match this pattern.

## Six Examples Coming...

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c5d2ab087f"
```

`@part1`
|Id|`Regex`|method|`Adele`|`Alan`|`Ana-Maria`|`Aolani`|`Arlene`|
|--|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|`.*an`|`re.match()`|  |`Alan`| |  `Aulan`| |
|2|`.*an`|`re.search()`| |`Alan`| |  `Aulan`| | 
|3|`an` |`re.match()`| | | | | | 
|4|`an, re.I` |`re.match()`| | |`An`| | | 
|5|`an` |`re.search()`| | `an`| |`an`| |
|6|`an, re.I` |`re.search()`| |`an`|`An`|`an`| | |

Note: `re.I` = `re.IGNORECASE`


`@script`
At the heart of this lesson, we'll examine the six cases as shown in this table.  The first case is the one from the previous lesson: the regular expression `.*an` with `re.match()`.  In the second case, we keep the regular expression the same but change the method to `re.search()` and see that the match results are exactly the same.  Why is this?  (pause) Well...  remember that `re.match()` attempts to match the regular expression to the target string.  In this case, the regular expression begins with the wildcard `.` and the quantifier `*` which matches zero or more of the previous character, which is the wildcard.  Therefore, the regular expression prefix `.*` basically means exactly what `re.match()` does.  This is why in Case 2, when we use the `re.search()` method, the results are the same.
The second pair of cases consists of Cases 3 and 5.  This is the pair of cases that clearly shows the difference between `re.match()` and `re.search()`.  Of these four cases the bottom line is that if you want to match Alan and Aolani, you have two choices: 
1. If you want to use `re.match()`, you need write the longer regular expression `.*an`.
2. On the other hand, if you want to write a minimalist regular expression like `an`, then you must use `re.search()` with it.
Case 4 is really based on Case 3 where there is no match.  In Case 3, the regular expression is `an` and you might see Ana-Maria and ask why didn't the `an` match Ana-Maria?  The answer is that by default, the match is case sensitive.  Thus, in Case 4, we add the `RegexFlag` or Compilation Flag `re.I` which is short for `re.IGNORECASE`.  With this modified regular expression, the `re.match()` matches the `An` in Ana-Maria.  Finally, Case 6 is similar to Case 4, except that in Case 6 we use the `re.search()` in contrast to Case 4 where we had used `re.match()`.  OK?  So, let's go ahead and examine these cases in more detail now in the next set of slides.


---
## Case 1: `re.compile(r'.*an')` with `re.match()`

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "418b893c06"
```

`@part1`
From the previous lesson, we can compile the regular expression: `r'.*an'`

Then we `re.match()` this to each name in the list as follows:

    `regexobj = re.compile(r'.*an')
     for sname in li_names:
         romatch = regexobj.match(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(romatch)}\t{romatch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 4), match='Alan'>
      Ana-Maria   False     None
      Aolani      True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 5), match='Aolan'>
      Arlene      False     None`


`@script`
This is Case 1.  In the first line if code, you can see that we compile the regular expression into the regular expression object `regexobj`.  Then, we have our "test harness" in the form of the `for` loop over the list `li_names` that contains the five names.  In the first line of the loop we apply the `re.match()` method of the `regexobj` to the target string, which is the string name that is supplied by the loop.  In the final line of the loop, we simply print-out the results, beginning with the name.  Logically, the second item to examine is the match object which, for convenience, is the right-most item of output.  The middle item is the Boolean or True/False result of the match object.  The output shows that we have succeeded in matching both Alan and Aolani, and you can see the string that the regular expression matched.


---
## Case 2: `re.compile(r'.*an')`  with `re.search()`

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bd26f900b5"
```

`@part1`
Now, using the same compiled regular expression object we `re.search()` each name in the list as follows:

    `regexobj = re.compile(r'.*an') # same as before
     for sname in li_names:
         rosearch = regexobj.search(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(rosearch)}\t{rosearch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 4), match='Alan'>
      Ana-Maria   False     None
      Aolani      True      <re.Match  object; span=(0, 5), match='Aolan'>
      Arlene      False     None`

In this case, the results from `re.match()` and `re.search()` are the same.


`@script`
Here in Case 2 we have the same regular expression, however in this case we use the `re.search()` method.  As we discussed earlier, the prefix of the regular expression, the wildcard `.` followed by the quantifier `*` essentially makes the `re.search()` behave like `re.match()` and you can see that the output results are the same.


---
## Case 3: `re.compile(r'an')` with `re.match()`

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "41ebd109c6"
```

`@part1`
Now, let us `re.match()` based on the shorter regular expression `r'an'`. 

    `regexobj = re.compile(r'an')
     for sname in li_names:
         romatch = regexobj.match(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(romatch)}\t{romatch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        False     None
      Ana-Maria   False     None
      Aolani      False     None
      Arlene      False     None`

There are no strings that begin with the string `an`.


`@script`
Now in Case 3, we omit the prefix `.*` from the regular expression.  Thus, our minimalist regular expression is the literal pattern `an`.  When we use the `re.match()` method, we can see the output results match nothing.


---
## Case 4: `re.compile(r'an', re.IGNORECASE)` with `re.match()`

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "02ef5ea941"
```

`@part1`
Can we modify the regular expression `r'an'` to match the `An` in `Ana-Maria`?

Yes, we can compile with the `RegexFlag` `re.IGNORECASE` = `re.I`:

    `regexobj_i = re.compile(r'an', re.IGNORECASE)
     for sname in li_names:
         romatch = regexobj_i.match(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(romatch)}\t{romatch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        False     None
      Ana-Maria   True      <re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='An'>
      Aolani      False     None
      Arlene      False     None`


`@script`
Case 4 is a response to Case 3.  Because there is no match, it is easier to notice that Ana-Maria begins with a capital "A" followed by "n."  Can the regular expression be modified to match this name?  Yes, it turns-out that one can enter a `RegexFlag`, formerly known as a "Compilation Flag" to ignore the case, as in uppercase and lowercase, in the target string.  As you can see, now, the same regular expression `an` with the accompanying `re.IGNORECASE` `RegexFlag`, i.e. compilation flag, can match the name: Ana-Maria.


---
## Case 5: `re.compile(r'an')` with `re.search()`

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "eb661075cc"
```

`@part1`
Now, let us `re.search()` based on the same shorter regular expression `r'an'`. 

    `regexobj = re.compile(r'an')
     for sname in li_names:
         rosearch = regexobj.search(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(rosearch)}\t{rosearch})`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        True      <re.Match  object; span=(2, 4), match='an'>
      Ana-Maria   False     None
      Aolani      True      <re.Match  object; span=(3, 5), match='an'>
      Arlene      False     None`

Here `re.search()` found matches because it searches within the target string.


`@script`
Finally, in Case 5 we have our minimalist matching of Alan and Aolani.  The regular expression is the literal pattern `an` and we use the `re.search()` method to look within the target string names from the list `li_names`.  The output shows the matching of `an`.


---
## Case 6: `re.compile(r'an', re.IGNORECASE)` with `re.search()`

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "91a3d7af1c"
```

`@part1`
As done earlier, to also match `Aolani`, we can compile with the `RegexFlag` `re.IGNORECASE` = `re.I`:

    `regexobj_i = re.compile(r'an', re.I)      # earlier, used re.IGNORECASE
     for sname in li_names:
         rosearch = regexobj_i.match(sname)
         print(f'{sname:7} \t{bool(rosearch)}\t{rosearch}')`

_output:_

     `Adele       False     None
      Alan        True      <re.Match  object; span=(2, 4), match='an'>
      Ana-Maria   True      <re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='An'>
      Aolani      <re.Match  object; span=(3, 5), match='an'>
      Arlene      False     None`


`@script`
Lastly, influenced by Case 4, we simply include the `RegexFlag` flag `re.I`, which is an alias or acceptable short version of `re.IGNORECASE`.  You can see that the output results now show that the regular expression `an` and ignore case flag matches three names.


---
## RegexFlags (formerly Compilation Flags)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "88c86142bd"
```

`@part1`
The [Documentation of re for Python 3.7.2](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-contents) states that the "compilation flags" are now known as `RegexFlags`.

The documentation describes several flags, however the `re.IGNORECASE = re.I` may be the most useful.

The [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-contents) lists `re.IGNORECASE = re.I` in an order that suggests it has the `enum` value of 2.  We can examine this by running the following code:

     `regexobj_i = re.compile(r"re", 2)
      print(regexobj_i)`

which produces the result:

     `re.compile('an', re.IGNORECASE)`


`@script`
The documentation, currently for Python 3.7.2, explains that these modifiers are now known as `RegexFlags`.

The documentation lists `re.I = re.IGNORECASE` in such a manner to suggest that the `enum` value is 2.

The code shown compiles the regular expression, and then prints the result.  You can see that the output shows that `re.I = re.IGNORECASE` has the `enum` value = 2.

## Your turn to practice...

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9b8a15d40e"
```

`@script`
Now, it's your turn to get some practice writing regular expressions and distinguishing between `re.match()` or `re.search()`.
